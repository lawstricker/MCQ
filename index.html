                <p>Lilly loves her new town. She loves the mall. She loves the parks. She also loves her
                    school. Most of all, though, Lilly loves the seasons. In her old town, it was hot all of the time.
                    Sometimes it is cold in Lilly's new town. The cold season is in winter. Once in a while it
                    snows. Lilly has never seen snow before. So for her, the snow is exciting as well as very
                    beautiful. Lilly has to wear gloves to keep her hands warm. She also wears a scarf around her
                    neck.
                    In spring, flowers bloom and the trees turn green with new leaves. Pollen falls on the cars
                    and windowsills and makes Lilly sneeze. People work in their yards and mow their grass.
                    In summer, Lilly wears her old shorts and sandals— the same ones she used to wear in
                    her old town. It’s hot outside, and dogs lie in the shade. Lilly and her friends go to a pool or play in
                    the water sprinkler. Her father cooks hamburgers on the grill for dinner.
                    Lilly’s favorite season is autumn. In autumn, the leaves on the trees turn yellow, gold, red,
                    and orange. Halloween comes in autumn, and this is Lilly’s favorite holiday. Every Halloween,
                    Lilly wears a costume. Last year she wore a mouse costume. This year she will wear a fish
                    costume.
                    One evening in autumn, Lilly and her mom are on sitting together on the porch. Mom tells
                    Lilly that autumn is also called “fall”. This is a good idea, Lilly thinks, because in fall all of the
                    leaves fall down from the trees.
